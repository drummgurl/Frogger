### How to Play

Visit [here](https://drummgurl.github.io/Frogger/) to play.

Follow these simple instructions to play: 

1. Once the game has loaded, use your keyboard arrow :arrow_left: :arrow_right: :arrow_up: :arrow_down: keys to move towards the water without colliding with a bug.
2. If you collide with a bug, the game will reset and you will end up back on the grass. 
3. If you make it to the water without collisions, you've beaten the game! 
4. Once the game is beaten, you will get a congratulatory window pop up and you can choose to replay if you want.
